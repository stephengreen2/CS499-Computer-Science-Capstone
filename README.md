## 📂 Artifacts

This repository contains three enhanced artifacts that demonstrate my growth across key areas of computer science:

1. **Software Design and Engineering**  
   - *Smart Thermostat Project*  
   - Refactored into a modular MVC architecture with improved documentation and enhanced security considerations.

2. **Algorithms and Data Structures**  
   - *Enhanced Sorting Project*  
   - Added advanced sorting algorithms (Merge, Quick, Heap) with benchmarking, modular design, input validation, and improved user experience.

3. **Databases**  
   - *Quantigration RMA Database*  
   - Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and implementation demonstrating relational database design, normalization, and SQL queries.

Each artifact is located in the [`artifacts/`](./artifacts) folder and includes documentation on enhancements and learning outcomes.
